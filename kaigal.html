              The falls is actually located between Devadoddi and Kaigal village. Nowadays, the buses halt at Kaigal. 
              There is a painting of Lord Hanuman near the entrance. From here, one has to walk nearly two kilometres into the deep jungle. As you enter the valley, you have to cross the river and take a left turn before you see the water actually falling down.[citation needed]
              There is board near the falls which is erected by Police dept. for "no trespassing". It is better seek out police assistance or approval before venturing into the waterfall.
