                One more beautiful weekend arrived and that too on a monsoon so we planned to explore few waterfalls around the stretch from Mulbagal to Vaniyambai this time around..
                 We started around 5.30 am from Bangalore and our BF pitstop was the Prasad Mulbagal dosa shop where we had the stupendous Mulbagal dosas and then kick started our drive to the Gidigi waterfalls which is around 120 kms from Bangalore and takes around 2.5 hrs if we start early..

            <p>
                We reached the place where we parked our cars after enquiring with the locals and then crossed a small dam which was super oveflowing with recent rains.. 
                After a pretty descent flat trail walk of 2 kms in a nice dense path we saw the first glance of the Gidigi waterfalls.. It was a very wide waterfalls with a short fall. We tried to reach the base but due to the extreme rains and overflow of water we just visited it from a safe distance and safety always comes first in any of our trips..
                The locals said the falls can be reached the base and played in water during post monsoon season. Spending about 30 mins enjoying the silence and bird chirping along with the roaring waterfalls we started back to car park for our next destination.
